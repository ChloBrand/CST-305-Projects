# Numeric Computations with Taylor Polynomials

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Taylor series and power series to approximate solutions to differential equations. The code includes solutions for:

1. **Taylor Series Expansion (Part 1a)**: Solves and visualizes the equation `y'' - 2xy' + x^2y = 0` using a 4th-order Taylor series expansion.
2. **Second-Order Taylor Polynomial (Part 1b)**: Solves and visualizes the equation `y'' - (x - 2)y' + 2y = 0` with a second-order Taylor polynomial centered at `x = 3`.
3. **Power Series Solution (Part 2)**: Generates and visualizes the general solution to a power series expansion for a given differential equation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the `TaylorPolynomials.py` script to generate the Taylor series approximations and visualizations.

   ```bash
   python TaylorPolynomials.py
   ```

## Outputs

The program generates the following visualizations:

1. **Part 1a**: Taylor series expansion plot for the equation `y'' - 2xy' + x^2y = 0`.
2. **Part 1b**: Second-order Taylor polynomial plot for the equation `y'' - (x - 2)y' + 2y = 0` centered at `x = 3`.
3. **Part 2**: Power series solution plot with terms up to `n â‰¤ 8`.
