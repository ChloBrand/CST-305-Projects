# CPU Temperature Simulation for Varying CPU Utilizations

This Python program simulates CPU temperature changes over time based on varying CPU utilization percentages. The model is governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that takes into account both heat generation from CPU utilization and cooling toward the ambient temperature.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the program:

- `numpy`: for numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: for plotting the results
- `scipy`: for solving the ODE

Install these libraries using pip if necessary:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Overview

### Model Description

The simulation uses the following ODE to model the change in CPU temperature over time:

$$
\frac{{dT}}{{dt}} = k_1 \cdot U(t) - k_2 \cdot (T(t) - T_{ambient})
$$

Where:
- \( T(t) \) is the CPU temperature at time \( t \) (in Fahrenheit).
- \( k_1 \) is a constant representing heat generated by CPU utilization (conversion factor).
- \( k_2 \) is the cooling constant representing the rate of cooling toward the ambient temperature.
- \( T_ambient \) is the ambient temperature (in Fahrenheit).
- \( U(t) \) is the CPU utilization at time \( t \), provided as a percentage (e.g., 20%, 50%, 80%, 100%).

### Constants Used

- `T0 = 73°F`: The initial temperature of the CPU.
- `T_ambient = 74°F`: The ambient room temperature.
- `k1 = 0.01`: The heat generation constant (adjusts heat rise based on utilization).
- `k2 = 0.02`: The cooling constant (adjusts the cooling rate).

### Time Points

The program simulates CPU temperature changes over a time range of 500 seconds, divided into 1000 intervals.

### CPU Utilization Percentages

The simulation runs for the following CPU utilization percentages:
- 20%
- 50%
- 80%
- 100%

## How It Works

1. The ODE is defined in the `temperature_model` function, which models the temperature change based on CPU utilization and cooling.
2. The program solves the ODE for each of the utilization percentages using `scipy.integrate.odeint`.
3. The results are plotted, showing how the CPU temperature evolves over time for each utilization level.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary packages listed above.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the TempVsCPU.py file
3. Run the program, and a plot will be generated displaying CPU temperature over time for different CPU utilization levels. 
4. The plot includes a legend, grid, and labels for clarity.

## Code

```python
# Created by Chloe Brandow and Gabriel Vander Klok
# Packages used include numpy, matplotlib, and scipy
# The approach involves modeling CPU temperature as an ODE that accounts for both heat generation and
# cooling effects, solving the ODE for different CPU utilization percentages, and visualizing the results
# using a time-temperature plot.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import odeint

# Define the function for CPU utilization U(t) based on utilization percentage
def cpu_utilization(utilization_percentage):
    return utilization_percentage  # Utilization is already in percentage (20%, 50%, etc.)

# Define the ODE: dT/dt = k1 * U(t) - k2 * (T(t) - T_ambient)
def temperature_model(T, t, k1, k2, T_ambient, utilization_percentage):
    Ut = cpu_utilization(utilization_percentage)  # Get the CPU utilization
    dTdt = k1 * Ut - k2 * (T - T_ambient)  # ODE in Fahrenheit
    return dTdt

# Fixed constants (in Fahrenheit and no user input)
T0 = 73  # Initial CPU temperature in Fahrenheit
T_ambient = 74  # Ambient temperature in Fahrenheit
k1 = 0.01  # Heat generation constant (utilization to °F conversion factor)
k2 = 0.02  # Cooling constant (cooling rate in °F per second)

# Time points (from 0 to 500 seconds, with 1000 intervals)
t = np.linspace(0, 500, 1000)

# CPU utilization percentages to simulate
utilization_percentages = [20, 50, 80, 100]  # In percentages

# Plotting the results
plt.figure()

for utilization in utilization_percentages:
    # Solve the ODE for each utilization percentage
    T_solution = odeint(temperature_model, T0, t, args=(k1, k2, T_ambient, utilization))

    # Plot the result for this utilization
    plt.plot(t, T_solution, label=f'Utilization {utilization}%')

# Adding labels and title to the plot
plt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.ylabel('CPU Temperature (°F)')
plt.title('CPU Temperature Over Time for Different CPU Utilizations (Fahrenheit)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Results

The output plot will display the temperature trajectory over 500 seconds for CPU utilization levels of 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%. It provides insight into how different utilization levels impact CPU temperature, with the cooling effect modeled by the difference between current and ambient temperatures.
